# wakfu-protocol

As you maybe know, since many versions now, dev team is rolling messages ID for each new version of wakfu

Luckily, I am able to retrieve most of the new ID for all the messages leaked some years ago now.

In this repo you can find the history of the wakfu protocol 
I am trying to keep up to date. Some new messages are not known for the moment because I need to analyze them.
But feel free to propose an update if you want
